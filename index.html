            The central character in the series is
            <span class="maincharacter">Harry Potter</span>, a boy who lives in the
            fictional town of Little Whinging, Surrey with his aunt, uncle, and
            cousin ‚Äì the Dursleys ‚Äì and discovers at the age of eleven that he is a
            wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people
            known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle
            world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn, and
            children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic
            schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding
            world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
            Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland, and it is here where most of
            the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his
            adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical,
            social, and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as
            friendships,infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams,
            anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself
            for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's
            increasingly-violent second wizarding war.
